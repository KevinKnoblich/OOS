Oberbilk Office Supplies, a fictional company generating reports and databases to be used in my data analysis portfolio

06/13/24
Added rudimentary database operations and EDA capabilities
Not functional/useful until data generation is harmonized (will be pushed together with automated and scheduled data generation)

Next:
*automated and scheduled data generation
*sales infrastructure (reports)
*overhaul of customer data collection (age, country)
*automatic validation of new data
*web presence
 - dashboard
 - press
 - corporate design
*automated social media presence through API
 

ALL DATA IS GENERATED BY FAKER PYTHON MODULE. NONE OF THE PERSONS, PRODUCTS OR SALES ARE REAL.
